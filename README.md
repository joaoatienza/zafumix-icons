# Zafumix icons 
I really like the Zafiro icon set for apps but I don't like their folders. I really like the Numix folders so here's a combination of the two. I run Gnome so I know it works with that. Haven't tried it with any other desktop environments. 

### Installing the icons

   - Copy the folder of the color you want to `~/.local/share/icons` (in user mode) or `/usr/share/icons`  
   
   - So if you want the blue Numix folder icons, copy zafumix-icons-blue into `~/.local/share/icons` (in user mode) or `/usr/share/icons`
