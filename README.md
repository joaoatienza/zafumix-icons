# Zafumix icons 
I really like the Zafiro icon set (https://github.com/zayronxio/Zafiro-icons) for apps but I don't like their folders. I really like the Numix (https://github.com/numixproject) folders, so here's a combination of the Numix 2023 onwards folders and Zafiro applications icons. I run Gnome on Debian and and Gnome on Arch so I know it works with those configurations. Haven't tried it with any other distros and desktop environments. 

### Installing the icons

   - Copy the folder of the color you want to `~/.local/share/icons` (in user mode) or `/usr/share/icons`  
   
   - So if you want the blue Numix folder icons, copy zafumix-icons-blue into `~/.local/share/icons` (in user mode) or `/usr/share/icons`
